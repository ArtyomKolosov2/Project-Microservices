# Project-Microservices

Application was implemented as a part of Udemy course [Microservices Architecture and Implementation on .NET 5](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-architecture-and-implementation-on-dotnet/)

See the overall picture of **implementations on microservices with .net tools** on real-world **e-commerce microservices** project;

There is a couple of microservices which implemented **e-commerce** modules over **Catalog, Basket, Discount** and **Ordering** microservices with **NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)** and **Relational databases (PostgreSQL, Sql Server)** with communicating over **RabbitMQ Event Driven Communication** and using **Ocelot API Gateway**.

* **SqlServer database** connection and containerization
* Using **Entity Framework Core ORM** and auto migrate to SqlServer when application startup
	
#### API Gateway Ocelot Microservice
* Implement **API Gateways with Ocelot**
* Sample microservices/containers to reroute through the API Gateways
* Run multiple different **API Gateway/BFF** container types	
* The Gateway aggregation pattern in Shopping.Aggregator

#### Docker Compose establishment with all microservices on docker;
* Containerization of microservices
* Containerization of databases
* Override Environment variables

## Run The Project
You will need the following tools:

* [.Net Core 7 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/5)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Installing
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up: (Before Run Start the Docker Desktop)
1. Clone the repository
2. Once Docker for Windows is installed, go to the **Settings > Advanced option**, from the Docker icon in the system tray, to configure the minimum amount of memory and CPU like so:
* **Memory: 4 GB**
* CPU: 2
3. At the root directory which include **docker-compose.yml** files, run below command:
```csharp
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
```

4. Wait for docker compose all microservices. That’s it! (some microservices need extra time to work so please wait if not worked in first shut)

5. You can **launch microservices** as below urls:

* **Catalog API -> http://host.docker.internal:8000/swagger/index.html**
* **Basket API -> http://host.docker.internal:8001/swagger/index.html**
* **Discount API -> http://host.docker.internal:8002/swagger/index.html**
* **Ordering API -> http://host.docker.internal:8004/swagger/index.html**
* **Shopping.Aggregator -> http://host.docker.internal:8005/swagger/index.html**
* **API Gateway -> http://host.docker.internal:8010/Catalog**
* **Rabbit Management Dashboard -> http://host.docker.internal:15672**   -- guest/guest
* **Portainer -> http://host.docker.internal:9000**   -- admin/admin1234
* **pgAdmin PostgreSQL -> http://host.docker.internal:5050**   -- admin@mail.com/admin1234

>Note: If you are running this application in macOS then use `docker.for.mac.localhost` as DNS name in `.env` file and the above URLs instead of `host.docker.internal`.
